I'm Hussaini Maina Usman, a software engineer & educator with 4 years of professional experience in building, deploying and maintaining mission critical backend services, mobile applications, and web frontends.

Over the years, I've built softwares that I'm proud of, some of which include an E-Learning Platform, Movie Streaming App, Scholarship Portal that generate revenue and are used by thousands of people today.

I also have 2 years of experience in teaching software engineering to absolute beginners, and even to those engineers looking to advance their career in software engineering.
