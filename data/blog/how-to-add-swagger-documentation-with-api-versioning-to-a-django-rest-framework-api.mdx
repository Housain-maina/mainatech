# Introduction

An API is like a contract between a provider and a consumer. Adding versioning to the API makes sure that consumers know when things change or break.

While an interactive documentation makes it easier to interact with the API in a web browser.

In this article, I'm going to teach you every thing you need to know in order to start adding documentation and versioning to your DRF API.

# Pre-requisite

To follow along with this tutorial, basic knowledge of building RESTful APIs with Django Rest Framework is required.

# Swagger Documentation

We are going to start with adding swagger documentation to our DRF API. I created a sample project you can use to follow along if you don't have one [sample project](https://github.com/Housain-maina/python-code-snippets/tree/main/django_apps/drf_swagger_docs_versioning).

## Step 1: Installing Dependencies

We'll be using `drf_spectacular`, a django package that makes it easier to add swagger documentation and automatically generates json and yaml schema.

```
pip install drf_spectacular
```

Add `drf_spectacular` to INSTALLED_APPS list

```py:settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ALL YOUR APPS
    'drf_spectacular',
]
```
